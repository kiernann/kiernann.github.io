Gluedown
================

Version 1.0.0 of my `gluedown` package has just been accepted on CRAN
and can now be installed\! The package allows R users to more easily
transition between vectors and printed markdown text. The `md_*()`
functions primarily use
[`glue::glue()`](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue) to concatenate R
vectors with the neccesary markdown syntax. By setting `results='asis'`
in the `knitr` chunk options on an `.Rmd` document, any printed markdown
vectors are included in the document body immediately following that
chunk.

## Installation

Version 1.0.0 of the package can now be installed from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gluedown):

``` r
install.packages("gluedown")
```

You can also install the most recent development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/kiernann/gluedown):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/gluedown")
```

## Content

The `gluedown` package covers nearly every section of the [GitHub
Flavored Markdown Specification](https://github.github.com/gfm/),
allowing users to create dozens of markdown block
types.

## Usage

``` r
library(gluedown)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(glue)
```

### Process

Say we have some vector of state names.

``` r
states <- sample(state.name, size = 5)
```

The simplest way to show this vector is with `print()`:

``` r
print(states)
#> [1] "Mississippi" "Maryland"    "Missouri"    "Illinois"    "Tennessee"
```

The `cat()` function provides a little more functionality, especially if
we tell `knitr` to return the results *as is*:

``` r
cat(states)
```

Mississippi Maryland Missouri Illinois Tennessee

To make this more readable, we can separate the elements with a spaces
and a new line character.

``` r
cat(states, sep = "  \n")
```

Mississippi  
Maryland  
Missouri  
Illinois  
Tennessee

To render this as a *bullet* list, we have to prepend each line with an
asterisk. Easily enough, but our once-simple `cat()` usage is now a
little cumbersome.

``` r
cat(paste("*", states), sep = "\n")
```

  - Mississippi
  - Maryland
  - Missouri
  - Illinois
  - Tennessee

Using `glue()`, the same result can be created more easily.

``` r
glue("* {states}")
```

  - Mississippi
  - Maryland
  - Missouri
  - Illinois
  - Tennessee

The `md_order()` function essentially wraps around the above `glue()`
usage.

``` r
md_bullet(states)
```

  - Mississippi
  - Maryland
  - Missouri
  - Illinois
  - Tennessee

### Pipes

All functions are designed to fit within the tidyverse ecosystem by
working with
[pipes](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html). Chain
together some code and print the formatted results to your markdown
document. Here, instead of copy-pasting this quote from Wikipedia, we
can use the `rvest` package to create a block quote programatically.

``` r
read_html("https://w.wiki/A58") %>% 
  html_node("blockquote") %>% 
  html_text(trim = TRUE) %>% 
  str_remove("\\[(.*)\\]") %>% 
  md_quote()
```

> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect
> Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the
> common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings
> of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish
> this Constitution for the United States of America.

The quote isn’t explictly contained in the `.Rmd` document, but it is
found in the `.md` file created and the `.html` file you’re reading now.

### Extensions

The package primarily uses [GitHub Flavored
Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM). With this flavor, some
useful extensions like [task
lists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-task-lists) are
supported on GitHub. Be mindful of how these results look in your venue
render.

``` r
legislation <- c("Houses passes", "Senate concurs", "President signs")
md_task(legislation, check = 1:2)
```

  - \[x\] Houses passes
  - \[x\] Senate concurs
  - \[ \] President signs

### Inline

You can also use `gluedown` to format R [inline code
results](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-4.html). First, use R to
calculate a result.

``` r
name <- sample(state.name, 1)
abb <- state.abb[match(name, state.name)]
# `r md_bold(name)`
# `r md_italic(abb)`
```

Then you can easily print that result in the middle of regular text with
markdown formatting. In this case, our randomly selected state is
**Georgia**, which has the abbreviation *GA*.
