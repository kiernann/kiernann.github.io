# usa 0.1.0

The initial version of my new ‘usa’ package is now live on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=usa). This package overwrites
the ‘datasets’ state objects and includes modern data frames of various
information about the United States of America.

## Base data

``` r
length(datasets::state.abb)
#> [1] 50
head(datasets::state.abb)
#> [1] "AL" "AK" "AZ" "AR" "CA" "CO"
```

Eventually, I decided an entire package was needed. The aforementioned
`state.abb` vector is one of eight “state” objects that ship with base R
as part of the `datasets` package: six vectors, one list, and a matrix
of outdated statistics. These objects were initially creared for
incluses in the language S, from which R is derived, released in 1976.

The various vectors describe six different data points for the fifty
states:

1.  State name.
2.  2-digit Postal Service abbreviation.
3.  Census region.
4.  Census division.
5.  Land area in square miles.
6.  Geographic center:
      - Longitude
      - Latitude

While these objects aren’t wildly outdated, they do not include any of
the United State’s many terriroties, including the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico, which are typically included in all Census data sets of
the states.

``` r
str(base.vectors)
#> List of 6
#>  $ state.name    : chr [1:50] "Alabama" "Alaska" "Arizona" "Arkansas" ...
#>  $ state.abb     : chr [1:50] "AL" "AK" "AZ" "AR" ...
#>  $ state.region  : Factor w/ 4 levels "Northeast","South",..: 2 4 4 2 4 4 1 2 2 2 ...
#>  $ state.division: Factor w/ 9 levels "New England",..: 4 9 8 5 9 8 1 3 3 3 ...
#>  $ state.area    : num [1:50] 51609 589757 113909 53104 158693 ...
#>  $ state.center  :List of 2
#>   ..$ x: num [1:50] -86.8 -127.2 -111.6 -92.3 -119.8 ...
#>   ..$ y: num [1:50] 32.6 49.2 34.2 34.7 36.5 ...
```

The `state.x77` matrix contains eight statistics for the fifty states
from various years between 1970 and 1976:

1.  Population estimate as of July 1, 1975.
2.  Per capita income (1974).
3.  Illiteracy (1970, percent of population).
4.  Life expectancy in years (1969–71).
5.  Murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate per 100,000 population
    (1976).
6.  Percent high-school graduates (1970).
7.  Mean number of days with minimum temperature below freezing
    (1931–1960).
8.  Land area in square miles.

```

## New data

The new data in this package serves two purposes:

1.  Provide the same information for the U.S. territories.
2.  Update statistics in a modern format.

Two achieve these goals, the ‘usa’ package contains many new vectors and
[tibbles](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html).

### Vectors

The vectors descibed above are *overwritten* to include the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico, the two non-state territories typically
included alongside the states in the Census Bureas various data sets.

``` r
setdiff(state.abb, datasets::state.abb)
#> character(0)
```

### States

The `usa::states` tibble contains all the identifying information on the
52 “states.”

``` r
show(usa::states)
#> # A tibble: 52 x 8
#>    name                 abb   fips  region    division               area   lat   long

#> # … with 42 more rows
```

### Facts

The `usa::facts` tibble is a modern version of the information found in
the old matrix, taken from official U.S. government sources:

1.  Full state name.
2.  Population estimate as of September 26, 2019.
3.  Date admitted to the union.
4.  Per capita income (2018).
5.  Life expectancy in years (2017-18).
6.  Murder rate per 100,000 population (2018).
7.  Percent high-school graduates (2019).
8.  Percent bachelor’s degree holders (2019).
9.  Mean number of days requiring heating per year (1981-2010).

By releasing this data as a third party package, these figures can be
periodically updated (i.e., following a new census). For permanent
examples of data, the old `state.x77` matrix or new `usa::state.x19`
matrices should be used.

### ZIP Codes

The ‘usa’ package also contains the `usa::zipcodes` tibble, which
contains the data from the recently archived
[‘zipcode’](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zipcode) package.

``` r
show(usa::zipcodes)
#> # A tibble: 44,336 x 5
#>    zip   city       state   lat  long
#>    <chr> <chr>      <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
#>  1 00210 Portsmouth NH     43.0 -71.0
#>  2 00211 Portsmouth NH     43.0 -71.0
#>  3 00212 Portsmouth NH     43.0 -71.0
#>  4 00213 Portsmouth NH     43.0 -71.0
#>  5 00214 Portsmouth NH     43.0 -71.0
#>  6 00215 Portsmouth NH     43.0 -71.0
#>  7 00501 Holtsville NY     40.9 -72.6
#>  8 00544 Holtsville NY     40.9 -72.6
#>  9 00601 Adjuntas   PR     18.2 -66.7
#> 10 00602 Aguada     PR     18.4 -67.2
#> # … with 44,326 more rows
```

The columsn of this tibble have also been saved as vectors; like
`usa::state.abb` is a column of `usa::states`, the `usa::zip.code`
vector contains *all* ZIP codes within the United States.

``` r
sample(usa::zip.code, 6)
#> [1] "40863" "17023" "70751" "79831" "29644" "32607"
sample(usa::city.name, 6)
#> [1] "Largo"            "Lee"              "Cuba"             "Washington Depot" "Bruceton Mills"  
#> [6] "Bass Lake"
```

### Counties

The `usa::counties` tibble contains the many state county subdivisions.

``` r
show(usa::counties)
#> # A tibble: 3,232 x 3
#>    fips  name     state
#>    <chr> <chr>    <chr>
#>  1 01001 Autauga  AL   
#>  2 01003 Baldwin  AL   
#>  3 01005 Barbour  AL   
#>  4 01007 Bibb     AL   
#>  5 01009 Blount   AL   
#>  6 01011 Bullock  AL   
#>  7 01013 Butler   AL   
#>  8 01015 Calhoun  AL   
#>  9 01017 Chambers AL   
#> 10 01019 Cherokee AL   
#> # … with 3,222 more rows
```

A vector of sorted county names is also included.

``` r
sample(usa::county.name, 6)
#> [1] "Navajo"       "Avery"        "Cameron"      "Rota"         "Rappahannock" "Bullitt"
```
